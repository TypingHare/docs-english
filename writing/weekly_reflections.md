## #1 Is my English Good?

I hate troubling others due to my introversion, and that's why when I get stuck in speaking, I often say "Sorry I'm not good at English, so ..." to reduce embarrassment. However, many people comfort me by praising me given that I am only an immigrant. I am not eager for the praises, instead, my purpose of saying that is to apologize for the fact that I have not yet mastered the language that I should have mastered. But since I've noticed that many people praise me seriously, not out of politeness, there must be some kind of misunderstanding. Recently, I have figured it out.

American natives have two primary sources of education: formal educators within the school system who impart specialized knowledge, and parents who provide valuable insights into life and general knowledge. These dual sources of guidance and learning are essential, as they complement one another, aiding in the development of a well-rounded understanding of the English language for American native children. However, children residing in families where English is not spoken are limited to acquiring English knowledge solely through schools. The absence of parental guidance in this regard results in several disadvantages for these non-native learners.

First starters, non-native learners often exhibit diverse accents. If an individual can speak their native language in a standardized manner, they possess the potential to achieve a similar standard in speaking any language. The persistence of accents stems from the lack of timely correction and guidance. During a child's teething phase, the parents begin to rectify their pronunciation patiently by repeating a word time after time. Unfortunately, many non-native learners do not have this valuable opportunity to refine their pronunciation, especially when their teachers also possess strong accents. Moreover, numerous learners attempt to pronounce other languages using the patterns of their native language. Nonetheless, they encounter difficulties when faced with pronunciation that doesn't exist in their mother tongue. Acquiring new pronunciation can be challenging, often requiring significant effort to build the necessary muscle memory. I vividly remember my initial attempts at mastering the American pronunciation of the word "problem". During my 20-minute commute from home to school, I incessantly repeated the word and practiced using it in various example sentences. I finally made it, and then I could pronounce the word "problem" in both British and American accents at will. This experience built up my confidence in speaking and made me believe that any pronunciation can be conquered by enough repetitions.

Secondly, non-native learners tend to prioritize vocabulary over practice, viewing vocabulary as a measure of their language proficiency. However, a common misconception among learners is that mastering a word only involves linking it to equivalent words in their native language. This misunderstanding often leads to challenges when attempting to use the words in constructing complete and coherent sentences. Due to their struggle to form sentences fluently like native speakers, they often feel hesitant to engage in conversation, leading to a self-imposed silence. On the other hand, native speakers learn through consistent practice. During early childhood, they learn by imitating what they hear. As they mature, they confidently construct more intricate sentences and express themselves without fear of criticism or judgment. After all, no one expects a child to be flawless. In essence, every native speaker experiences a valuable phase in which they can express themselves freely without constraints—an invaluable practice that significantly contributes to the development of language skills.

Thirdly, individuals tend to heavily rely on their native language. When a child begins to learn about the world, they do so in their mother tongue. The blend of curiosity and the fear of being unable to express their true feelings consistently drives them to seek more words. When encountering something new and struggling to articulate it, a person's eagerness to learn its name and commit it to memory intensifies. This desire stems from the aspiration to share it with others in the future. However, if a person learns a word they can already translate into their native language, their brain tends to idle, as they subconsciously believe they can easily look up the word in a mobile dictionary.

Based on the analysis above, I can infer the reason for the compliments I receive regarding my English proficiency. It appears that my relatively clear pronunciation, devoid of a noticeable foreign accent, contributes to the positive feedback. However, from my perspective, I struggle to construct simple sentences that even a six-year-old child could do in their sleep. My limited vocabulary hinders me from accurately expressing my ideas and emotions. Most importantly, I find myself unable to embody my true persona and convey my intended message while speaking English.

## #2 Plausible Advice 

> I decided not to use ChatGPT to improve my writing. Although ChatGPT is a wonderful tool for doing that, it wipes off my n, writing styles and true feelings, and uncovers my mistakes that need to be corrected.

As usual, I wake up in darkness, with a clear consciousness that does not allow me to fall into sleep again. I hear the rumble of the trains passing by. They all have specific destinations and rush to somewhere they can arrive at and pertain to. It is sad to realize that the destination of humans is death. Perhaps only me. High school students await admittance from their ideal universities; college students await the responses from job interviews; working professionals await their promotions; I await the last breathtaking afterglow. Time passes slowly in sorrow and through the window of my room, comes a ray of sunshine. Another day begins.

I always ask others how to improve my English. The answer is somehow uniform: "to speak with more native speakers". For a long period, I took it as truth, and I had been feeling guilty that I didn't dare to make more friends. But recently, I felt a little bit of displeasure when my parents said again: "You should go and make friends with natives."

"But who wants to make friends with you?" I replied straightforwardly. People are not NPC (non-playable characters in games), and they make friends out of certain benefits. When I was in China, I was in the so-called top class in middle school and high school. I had been into helping others with problems in learning. And in that atmosphere, students prefer to discuss studying rather than entertainment. So how did I get some friends? I simply helped them out, then talked about our interests and ambitions, and over. They would come back to me when they had new problems, and we kept in touch with each other naturally. Even though I was not good at socializing at all, I was not afraid of lacking friends.

However, the language barrier hit me out of my comfort zone. It deprives me of the ability to explain things in detail, let alone help others. That was the cause of my depression when I was living in Chicago, during which I had only three to four hours of sleep every day. Worse, I feel a little progress has been made in the past year after moving to Boston. Last month, our family was invited to a birthday party for the daughter of my parent's friend. I was reluctant to go because introverted me must be a party pooper. When they said, "There are many kids of your age, and you can play with them." I got mad. I was clear that those "kids" were ABC, and there was nothing I could talk about with them in a common language. Here is their home court, and I had to come up with topics, translate them into English, and try to ground my language. What made me angry and stressed me out was that this challenging task looked like a pleasure in their eyes.

Finally, I went to the party. I tried my best to squeeze out the American-style smiles and take the initiative to talk to them, pretending that I had prepared nothing for it. I failed, in terms of joining in. Later they went to a nearby park without taking me, and my father and his friend, who is the father of an ABC, surprisingly asked me "Didn't they take you to the park? I thought you go out with them." Oh interesting, how come?

"Go and talk with natives" seems to be a piece of good advice, but some of the advisors are enjoying a great environment that they think all people should have. In China, some kids prepare to study abroad when they are young, and their parents can afford the expensive one-to-one tutoring; some are studying in foreign language schools; and some live in bilingual families because their parents are well-educated. When I lay down in a meadow in the sun, observing how ants moved their homes with my friends, planes above my head flew across the sky, in which rich kids were on their way touring the world. They take those for granted, as they believe they grasp a foreign language with their inherent wits. Indeed, I am stupid, and disappoint everyone who had hope in me.

I am writing this not to complain about either my family or myself, but to explain my true feelings at the brink of mind-breaking. Sun goes down, and another night has come.

## #3 Learning to Walk in Handan

"邯郸学步" is an idiom in Chinese which used to describe someone who superficially imitates or mimics something without truly understanding it. The phrase originates from an ancient Chinese story about a man from Handan who imitated the walking style of the local people, thinking he had mastered it, but in reality, he had not.

## #4 Expressing Emotions

It is widely acknowledged that language serves as a crucial tool for conveying ideas and thoughts. However, amidst this, the aspect of expressing emotions often remains neglected. When individuals communicate in their native language, they effortlessly convey emotions without getting caught up in the process. In reality, children learn how to express emotions before mastering the art of conveying thoughts, and for many, this initial learning experience becomes a distant memory. Nevertheless, when it comes to non-native learners, the emphasis typically leans towards conveying ideas rather than expressing emotions. This is largely due to the predominant use of language in professional and academic settings for work, study, and business, where the priority lies in effective communication rather than displaying humor or lightheartedness. Consequently, expressing emotions presents a notable gap between native speakers and non-native learners.
