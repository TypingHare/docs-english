# Brief Retrospective on English Learning

## Prologues

My journey of pondering the intricacies of English commenced when I found myself totally incapable of conveying my thoughts and submerged in unprecedented helplessness. On Oct 7th, 2022, an airliner landed to Chicago O'Hare Internation Airport

I love math and computer science with no lofty ideas, but because I find them interesting and get exhilarated when I solve problems. Innovating is amazing. It has become a well that never runs dry, continuously giving out the water of survival, from which I can gain essential meanings to support my life. But now, as I have immigrated to this country, and it seems I will spend a long span of time here, learning, or more ambitiously, mastering English should be undoubtedly the most imperative task for the time being. It has been already two years since the plane landed, but I have no prominent.

## 1 Steps for translating

How many steps are there in translating a sentence? Before I came to America, my answer would be three: (1) Break a sentence into words and phrases, (2) translate the words and phrases, and (3) place them in the right order. It is so straightforward that every language learner can easily accept it. However, I realized that these three steps are totally inadequate to "translate well". I didn't major in translation, so it took me much effort to figure out what is the key to translating. Let's first analyze the three steps:

First, break a sentence into words and phrases. It is common for beginners to find it hard to translate because they do not know the translation of some words and phrases, and therefore they will try many ways to enlarge their vocabulary volume. I, as a typical Chinese student, learn words by

## 2 Mappings and Connections

### Mapping
What is the understanding of a word? When I ask a native speaker the meaning of a word, they may do two things: first, give the definition of the word; or second, make some example sentences with a bunch of assumptions. The first approach is effective for explaining nouns that refer to concrete entities, while the second one is more helpful for letting others understand words that are formless and abstract. The two approaches reflect two different ways people understand wordsâ€“mapping and connections.

Mapping in math refers to a relation such that each element of a given set is associated with an element of another set. Every word has one or multiple meanings, which are often called entries. Every entry corresponds to an abstract understanding in a person's mind. The abstract understanding is unspeakable, and thus is usually associated with a word, which is helpful in terms of communication. For instance, "table" refers to a piece of furniture with a flat top and several legs. We don't have this word when it did not exist, or rigorous speaking, it hadn't existed in anyone's mind. The first carpenter named it when they made out the first table; and after that, people began to use this word to refer to it. So how a mapping relation is established in this case? There are three steps: (1) A person sees a table and an abstract understanding is established in mind; (2) The person is told a new word "table"; (3) The person knows that the word refers to what he sees. Logically, all steps above are necessary to build up the mapping relation.

What happens if the step (1) is missing? Imagine you let a blind person touch a table and then tell them it is a "table". They will say "I get it" and the next time they may recognize a chair as a table. That's a common situation for learners who live in a country that barely uses English. They don't really know what a word is like the blind person, and guess the meaning of it by translation tools. I will delve deeper in the next chapter.

Missing the step (2) is simply called vocabulary omissions. It is so common that there is no need to put any examples here.

Missing the step (3) leads to incorrect mappings. A typical instance is that "football" refers to two different sports in North America and the UK, and since Chinese students are taught British English, many of them make misunderstandings when talking with American friends.

### Connection

A typical example is "love". Through the ages, philosophers have kept arguing about the definition of love. Nonetheless, you will easily find that any literal definitions of "love" are futile, because this word is used to refer to a particular emotion we have, but how do we know whether others have the same feelings when they refer them to love? In fact, "love" is broadly used to refer to a set of emotions, and we are facing a lack of words to specify each of them.
