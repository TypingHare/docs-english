## #1 Is my English Good?

I hate troubling others due to my introversion, and that's why when I get stuck in speaking, I often say "Sorry I'm not good at English, so ..." to reduce embarrassment. However, many people comfort me by praising me given that I am only an immigrant. I am not eager for the praises, instead, my purpose of saying that is to apologize for the fact that I have not yet mastered the language that I should have mastered. But since I've noticed that many people praise me seriously, not out of politeness, there must be some kind of misunderstanding. Recently, I have figured it out.

American natives have two primary sources of education: formal educators within the school system who impart specialized knowledge, and parents who provide valuable insights into life and general knowledge. These dual sources of guidance and learning are essential, as they complement one another, aiding in the development of a well-rounded understanding of the English language for American native children. However, children residing in families where English is not spoken are limited to acquiring English knowledge solely through schools. The absence of parental guidance in this regard results in several disadvantages for these non-native learners.

First starters, non-native learners often exhibit diverse accents. If an individual can speak their native language in a standardized manner, they possess the potential to achieve a similar standard in speaking any language. The persistence of accents stems from the lack of timely correction and guidance. During a child's teething phase, the parents begin to rectify their pronunciation patiently by repeating a word time after time. Unfortunately, many non-native learners do not have this valuable opportunity to refine their pronunciation, especially when their teachers also possess strong accents. Moreover, numerous learners attempt to pronounce other languages using the patterns of their native language. Nonetheless, they encounter difficulties when faced with pronunciation that doesn't exist in their mother tongue. Acquiring new pronunciation can be challenging, often requiring significant effort to build the necessary muscle memory. I vividly remember my initial attempts at mastering the American pronunciation of the word "problem". During my 20-minute commute from home to school, I incessantly repeated the word and practiced using it in various example sentences. I finally made it, and then I could pronounce the word "problem" in both British and American accents at will. This experience built up my confidence in speaking and made me believe that any pronunciation can be conquered by enough repetitions.

Secondly, non-native learners tend to prioritize vocabulary over practice, viewing vocabulary as a measure of their language proficiency. However, a common misconception among learners is that mastering a word only involves linking it to equivalent words in their native language. This misunderstanding often leads to challenges when attempting to use the words in constructing complete and coherent sentences. Due to their struggle to form sentences fluently like native speakers, they often feel hesitant to engage in conversation, leading to a self-imposed silence. On the other hand, native speakers learn through consistent practice. During early childhood, they learn by imitating what they hear. As they mature, they confidently construct more intricate sentences and express themselves without fear of criticism or judgment. After all, no one expects a child to be flawless. In essence, every native speaker experiences a valuable phase in which they can express themselves freely without constraints—an invaluable practice that significantly contributes to the development of language skills.

Thirdly, individuals tend to heavily rely on their native language. When a child begins to learn about the world, they do so in their mother tongue. The blend of curiosity and the fear of being unable to express their true feelings consistently drives them to seek more words. When encountering something new and struggling to articulate it, a person's eagerness to learn its name and commit it to memory intensifies. This desire stems from the aspiration to share it with others in the future. However, if a person learns a word they can already translate into their native language, their brain tends to idle, as they subconsciously believe they can easily look up the word in a mobile dictionary.

Based on the analysis above, I can infer the reason for the compliments I receive regarding my English proficiency. It appears that my relatively clear pronunciation, devoid of a noticeable foreign accent, contributes to the positive feedback. However, from my perspective, I struggle to construct simple sentences that even a six-year-old child could do in their sleep. My limited vocabulary hinders me from accurately expressing my ideas and emotions. Most importantly, I find myself unable to embody my true persona and convey my intended message while speaking English.

## #2 Plausible Advice 

> I decided not to use ChatGPT to improve my writing. Although ChatGPT is a wonderful tool for doing that, it wipes off my creativity, writing styles, and true feelings, and uncovers my mistakes that need to be corrected.

As usual, I wake up in darkness, with a clear consciousness that does not allow me to fall into sleep again. I hear the rumble of the trains passing by. They all have specific destinations and rush to somewhere they can arrive at and pertain to. It is sad to realize that the destination of humans is death. Perhaps only me. High school students await admittance from their ideal universities; college students await the responses from job interviews; working professionals await their promotions; I await the last breathtaking afterglow. Time passes slowly in sorrow and through the window of my room, comes a ray of sunshine. Another day begins.

I always ask others how to improve my English. The answer is somehow uniform: "to speak with more native speakers." For a long period, I took this as truth, and I had been feeling guilty that I didn't dare to make more friends. But recently, I felt a little bit of displeasure when my parents said again: "You should go and make friends with natives."

"But who wants to make friends with you?" I replied straightforwardly. People are not NPC (non-playable characters in games), and they make friends out of certain benefits. In China, I was in the so-called top class in middle and high school. I had been into helping others with problems in learning. And in that atmosphere, students prefer to discuss studying rather than entertainment. So how did I get some friends? I simply helped them out, then talked about our interests and ambitions, and over. They would return to me when they had new problems, and we kept in touch naturally. Even though I was not good at socializing at all, I was not afraid of lacking friends.

However, the language barrier hit me out of my comfort zone. It deprives me of the ability to explain things in detail, let alone help others. That was the cause of my depression when I was living in Chicago, during which I had only three to four hours of sleep every day. Worse, I feel a little progress has been made in the past year after moving to Boston. Last month, our family was invited to a birthday party for the daughter of my parent's friend. I was reluctant to go because introverted me must be a party pooper. When they said, "There are many kids of your age, and you can play with them." I got mad. I was clear that those "kids" were ABC, and there was nothing I could talk about with them in a common language. Here is their home court, and I had to come up with topics, translate them into English, and try to ground my language. What made me angry and stressed was that this challenging task looked like a pleasure in their eyes.

Finally, I went to the party. I tried my best to squeeze out the American-style smiles and take the initiative to talk to them, pretending that I had prepared nothing for it. I failed, in terms of joining in. Later they went to a nearby park without taking me, and my father and his friend, who is the father of an ABC, surprisingly asked me: "Didn't they take you to the park? I thought you go out with them." Oh interesting, how come?

"Go and talk with natives" seems to be a piece of good advice, but some advisors are enjoying a great environment that they think all people should have. In China, some kids prepare to study abroad when they are young, and their parents can afford the expensive one-to-one tutoring; some are studying in foreign language schools; and some live in bilingual families because their parents are well-educated. When I lay down in a meadow in the sun, observing how ants moved their homes with my friends, planes above my head flew across the sky, in which rich kids were on their way touring the world. They take those for granted, as they believe they grasp a foreign language with their inherent wits. Indeed, I am stupid, and disappoint everyone who had hope in me.

I am writing this not to complain about either my family or myself, but to explain my true feelings at the brink of mind-breaking. Sun goes down, and another night has come.

## #3 Learning to Walk in Handan

"邯郸学步" is an idiom in Chinese which used to describe someone who superficially imitates or mimics something without truly understanding it. The phrase originates from an ancient Chinese story about a man from Handan who imitated the walking style of the local people, thinking he had mastered it, but in reality, he had not.

Two weeks ago, my mom asked me: "What is English grammar?" She could not understand it, and so did I. For years, I was told that English grammar is a set of rules for using English. You cannot tell why this is correct or why that is wrong. You cannot invent a new rule and ask everyone to accept it unless there are indeed many people who back it up. It is what it is.

So I answered my mom's question: "It is a way of speaking or writing that will not confuse natives." I then gave her some Chinese sentences which are literally translated from daily English sentences, and asked her what did she feel. She shook her head and said she couldn't understand. She was confused because the ordering of sentence components in these translations does not conform to Chinese grammar.

Interestingly, upon I translated those sentences into English using Google Translate, which assured the correctness of grammar, my mom still didn't understand them. Why could this happen? It turns out that people in different countries convey their thoughts and feelings in different ways. I refer to people's habitual organization of language as language logic. Although I am not a linguist, I feel that the disparities in language logic become more pronounced over distance.

Perhaps this is why Chinese students are often considered not expressive in America. Even though they spend a lot of time perfecting their grammar, their sentences still make a little sense to native speakers. This problem is particularly serious when Chinese students express their emotions or sense of humor. Many people think of it as an unbridgeable gap, and they just give up and have fun with people who speak the same language as them. I am also afraid of this gap. It looks like a bottomless abyss, where stormy winds and wailing echoes surged from within. When people try all means to go over it, I jump into it.

Last week I spent time browsing TikTok, and I mainly focused on the highly liked comments. After several days of reading and thinking, I got some ideas—people are "repeating". When they watch a video, they come up with something that impressed them in the past. They repeat what they have seen or heard before and type it down. If these happen to be collective memory, they will get lots of likes. Here, the keyword is "collective memory", which are ingrained in most people's mind, either good or bad, joy or misery, serious or hilarious. Until now, I haven't found an efficient way to get the collective memory and put it into my head. Maybe watching famous movies, reading popular books, and browsing trending news are worth a try.

But now, I am bothered by another problem. I try to mimic how natives speak, and even though far from authentic, I am getting closer. But will I end up being neither Chinese nor American? I don't know. Any masterpiece starts from parody. At least I made my very first one two days ago when I chatted with a native, who has a similar personality to me, and the context is as follows.

> \- **Patrick**: honestly its super buggy for me even though I got it working. I copy paste examples from the book and they don't compile.
>
> \- **Me**: Ok now you know more about C++ (sad
>           It is too low-level, always error-prone
>
> \- **Patrick**: Yeah I tried to learn plain C and it was even worse XD
>
> \- **Me**: POV: Bro spent 10 hours on C and he just time traveled to 10 hours later.
>
> \- **Patric**: LOL
>               pretty much.
>               once I saw the memcpy() and ** pointers I was like I'm out
## #4 Harsh Sounds

A few months ago when I was browsing short videos, a title caught my eye—You should NOT be concerned about your accent. The video claimed that native speakers do not care about foreigners' accents and therefore Chinese people should be more confident in their "Chinglish". The accent as well as the Chinese-style expressions can be seen as an identification. In the comment section, a majority of Chinese netizens agreed with this opinion, and some even say those who try hard to get rid of their accents are fawning at foreign powers (崇洋媚外). But many commenters ignored the background of the video maker—a multinational businessman. When it comes to business talk, it's for sure that natives are lenient with your accents and expressions. But there are some occasions where strong accents will ruin lots of things, such as presentations, debates, and conferences.

I am instructive and I am fond of presenting. When I was at the university in China, I was always responsible for the final representation of teamwork. I mastered how to make the instructions and explanations clearer, lively, and interesting. And I received applause from the audience, and praise from professors. My standard Mandarin was an essential part of my success. According to my dormmates, no matter how fast I spoke, they were able to catch every syllable I uttered and felt comfortable with my speech. Whenever I received praise like this, I was delighted that my efforts to speak standard Mandarin finally paid off.

Now I am at the age of 24, and I can feel that my ability to imitate is receding. I cannot hear the difference between my pronunciation and the natives', but my friends say they can. And even though sometimes I can discern the difference, I fail to utter the correct sound no matter how hard I try. What I have been wondering is what my speaking sounds like to others. I hope it does not sound harsh. 

## #5 Time is Not the Panacea for Ignorance

This week, I would like to criticize three wrong views about learning languages.

When my family arrived in America, I was anxious about my English ability. I memorized words all day long but it didn't help with it. When I expressed my misery and desperation to my parents, they always replied like this: "How long have you been here? You will get better several years later, and your English level will be just like a native speaker." I never took their words as a consolation, for I knew that they never understood how hard it is to master a language on their own.

Many people are like my parents, believing that as long as you live in an English country, your English will improve day by day. Generally speaking, it's true. But as a scientist, I would like to analyze things quantitatively instead of saying true or false. So my question would be: How many years will it take for an English learner to reach the C2 level?

It's a good topic to do some research. The number of days to master English depends on how much time you spend every time, how hard you work, how much talent you have, how good your approaches are, and so on. If a person spends 20 minutes on Duolingo every day, he can only make tiny progress a year later. I can confirm this because I just have a 400-day streak on Duolingo for my Japanese. In the past 400 days, I've learned nothing more than about 500 words and several pieces of grammar. So we shouldn't be blindly content with our progress, but quantify the progress we make and how much percentage we get closer to the C2 level.

Another common mistake is that accents are impossible to get rid of. I believe that people who can speak standardly in their native language can do the same things in a foreign language. The biggest obstacle to achieving this goal is to realize the differences between themselves and native speakers. Many people think they pronounce as accurately as natives, but natives can tell where they come from at the end of their first sentence. Besides, people don't change their accent over time, unless they pay attention to it and make efforts. People pronounce incorrectly or inaccurately because they don't control their mouth muscles in the right way. Changing the adaptions of muscles is neither easy nor difficult. It only requires you to try any possible shape of your mouth and position of your tongue to find the correct way to pronounce and repeat for 10 minutes to get accustomed to it. However, this doesn't work if the speakers themselves cannot hear the differences.

Last but not least, children don't learn languages by themselves. They have been taught by parents and teachers for years. I've told my mom many times that It's difficult to make friends with natives because I don't know much about their culture. The reason why culture is arduous for non-natives to learn is that most of it comes from experience, not from books. People acquire cultural knowledge by exposing themselves to an authentic environment. Many people have been living in America for half of their lives and still know little about American culture. These people have been staying in Chinatown for most time, and go to colleges only when they need to get a degree. Now the biggest challenge for me is to expose myself to a virtual environment and learn all natives have learned by myself.

## \# 6 First TOEFL Review

I must take back my claim that I have made decent progress since coming to America. My TOEFL score is more convincing than anything else. But it is important to note that the challenging conditions on test day and a stroke of bad luck also played a role. I got a 92 out of 120 for the test, and here are the details:

* **Reading (24)** - The first passage is about the history of Britain and the Roman Empire; the second passage is a botany science article. I was at a loss when I was doing the first passage because I often spend more than 20 minutes on historical articles. Therefore, I chose to believe my intuition and give up double-checking. I had almost 20 minutes for the second passage. However, the questions in the second passage are really difficult and hard to locate.
* **Listening (22)** - Too much liberal arts. I blame my low score for my extremely poor mental state. I couldn't focus on the audio and missed many parts. In practice exams, my score ranged from 22~28, and this time, I got the lowest in the interval.
* **Speaking (22)** - This section is exactly the cause of my tachycardia. I was completely relieved when I finished this section. I think I need some effective means to improve it.
* **Writing (24)** - I thought I could get around 27 or 28 when I finished the test. This final score really disappointed me. Both parts are quite easy for me, and I wrote a lot (about 250 words for the first part, and about 130 for the second part). I also double-checked the grammar in the last few minutes. I have been wondering the reason for getting such a low score.

I believe that I could have gotten over 95 if the test had been easier and I had got enough sleep. Looking forward to the future, 100 will be my aspiration for the second TOEFL test.

## \#N Expressing Emotions

It is widely acknowledged that language serves as a crucial tool for conveying ideas and thoughts. However, amidst this, the aspect of expressing emotions often remains neglected. When individuals communicate in their native language, they effortlessly convey emotions without getting caught up in the process. In reality, children learn how to express emotions before mastering the art of conveying thoughts, and for many, this initial learning experience becomes a distant memory. Nevertheless, when it comes to non-native learners, the emphasis typically leans towards conveying ideas rather than expressing emotions. This is largely due to the predominant use of language in professional and academic settings for work, study, and business, where the priority lies in effective communication rather than displaying humor or lightheartedness. Consequently, expressing emotions presents a notable gap between native speakers and non-native learners.
