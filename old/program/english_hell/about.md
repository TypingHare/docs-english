# English Hell

I've been in America for two years, during which I haven't made much progress. Recently, I have been contemplating the reason for my slow progress, but the more I ponder, the heavier my depression goes. I know I am beyond hope, and it is time to risk death and survive (置死地而后生). For the past few days, I come up with the idea that language is not being learned, it is being repeated and imitated. When I was browsing short videos, I absorbed a bunch of concepts, which linked some events, social affairs, famous lines, or other concepts together. Later when I browsed other videos that have common with those concepts, it reminded me of all memory that related to these concepts, and I could make a humorous or sarcastic comment.

I realized that the language barrier and culture gap come from the things we come into contact with every day are very different. I tried to force myself to use the English internet many times, but I always ended up in failure. That's why I call this program *English Hell*. I understand how hard it is and, if I fail to make it this time, I have no choice but to kick the bucket.

The first period will last for one week, from *Oct 2, 2023,* to *Oct 8, 2023*. I will not be allowed to use Chinese except in the following cases:

1. Learning English. For instance, memorizing vocabulary and making Chinese-English comparison tables.
2. Chating with Chinese friends and parents.
3. Talking with parents and people who don't speak English.
4. Following Asian Games news (especially about Go).
5. Using Chinese Apps to learn English (must be All English Teaching).

I will be free to use the Chinese Internet on *Oct 9, 2023*.
